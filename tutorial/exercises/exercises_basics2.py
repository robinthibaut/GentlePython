#  A Gentle Introduction to Python 2022. Robin Thibaut, Ghent University

# Awesome Python Tutorial For Beginners
# This is a tutorial of the Python Programming Language.
# Here are fun exercises to solve together in the class!

# Exercise 1 - Write a function to print "Raccoon" n times
# where n is a number defined by the user.

# Exercise 2 - Write a function to print "Raccoon" n times
# but backwards.

# Exercise 3 - Our favorite characters:
# Raccoon
# Fox
# Squirrel
# Create a list of these characters and add a few more in
# the list.
# Then, convert the list to a tuple.

# Exercise 4 - Given 2 lists as below,
# change the list of lists to a tuple of dictionaries.
a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
b = [["One", "Two", "Three"], ["Four", "Five", "Six"]]

# Exercise 5 - Print a random number between zero and one.
# Hint: use import random

# Exercise 6 - Given a list of numbers, check if all the
# numbers are divisible by 7. If they are divisible,
# return True otherwise False.
list_of_numbers = [33, 49, 63, 81, 91, 105, 112]


# Exercise 7 - Given a list of numbers, double every number
# in the list and print them out.
# Hint: use for loop

# Exercise 8 - Write a Python class named Rectangle which
# takes 3 parameters : width, height and color.
# A Rectangle instance has a color and area.

# Exercise 9 - Complete the solution to the problem
# "What is the longest word in a given sentence?"
def problem_longest_word(sentence):
    # write your code here.
    pass


sentence = "Raccoon is a funny animal."
print(problem_longest_word(sentence))
